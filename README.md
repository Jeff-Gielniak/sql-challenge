The Entity Relationship Diagram is in the 'QuickDBD-Module 9 Challenge.png' file

The 'Query.sql' file has the code to create the six tables and run the analysis to answer the 8 questions.  (The csv data was imported after the tables were created, but is not shown in the code obviously)

Screenshots of answers to the 8 questions is in the 'Data Analysis' folder

The 'data' folder just holds the original csv files.
