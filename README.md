# Employee Information Database (using SQL)
Author: Jeff Gielniak
Date: 2025-01-31

Using CSV files, data was cleaned and uploaded into a SQL database using QuickDBD.  The data was then queried to answer questions about employees that had or still worked at the company

The 'data' folder just holds the original csv files.
